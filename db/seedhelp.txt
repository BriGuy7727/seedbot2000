__Seed Creation Commands:__

**!randomseed standard** or **!rando** - rolls a seed with light randomization. Perfect for quick pick-up-and-go runs.

**!randomseed chaos** or **!chaos** - if you like your flagsets to be a little more wacky, this one's for you! Much more liberal randomization can lead to some really interesting settings.

**!randomseed true_chaos** or **!true_chaos** - this one randomizes... literally everything... with no weighting whatsoever. Test your FF6WC skill and knowledge... and your patience!

**!randomseed jones_special** or **!jones_special** - this rolls Jones's current personal favorite flagset. Strap in for fun!

**!rollseed <flagset>** - rolls a seed from the specified flagset

__Additional Arguments:__
