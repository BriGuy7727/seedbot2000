__Seed Creation Commands:__

**!randomseed standard** or **!rando** - rolls a seed with light randomization. Perfect for quick pick-up-and-go runs.

**!randomseed chaos** or **!chaos** - if you like your flagsets to be a little more wacky, this one's for you! Much
more liberal randomization can lead to some really interesting settings.

**!randomseed true_chaos** or **!true_chaos** - this one randomizes... literally everything... with no weighting
whatsoever. Test your FF6WC skill and knowledge... and your patience!

__Other Commands:__

**!myseeds** - get a list of every seed I've rolled for you.

**!rollseed <flagset>** - rolls a seed from the specified flagset
